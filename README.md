first experience with MERN stack that took me one month of summer internship

it is not even complete and there are some bad coding strategies in it but i am just glad that i knew all the stuff i did about those specific technologies 
maybe i will change it to a better code not that lazy one , but fr now i'll try to do something better , thanks for your attention :D!
